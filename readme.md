This application is my first attempt at writing something with a GUI (using Qt), and it is currently almost identical to the tutorial I used on qt-project.org. Some changes will probably be made to add some more functionality as time allows.

The full tutorial can be found <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qtwidgets-mainwindows-application-example.html">here</a>.
